# SWEET_AMELIA

This folder contains all the short scripts I’ve built over the years while learning **C++**.  

💡 Notes:  
- Programming is infinite — there’s always more to learn.  
- I fully accept that I’m still an amateur; I haven’t explored other tech stacks yet that would allow me to build larger, real-world projects.  
- To become what you want in this field, you need to be **obsessed** with it. That’s the brutal truth, because the field itself is beyond brutal.  

⚠️ Some of these scripts might not run properly because they rely on local assets from my computer.
