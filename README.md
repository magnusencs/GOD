This folder contains all the short scripts I’ve built over the years while learning **C++**.  

💡 Notes:  
- Programming is infinite, there’s always more to learn.  
- I fully accept that I’m still an amateur; I haven’t explored other tech stacks yet that would allow me to build larger, real-world projects.  
  

⚠️ Some of these scripts might not run properly because they rely on local assets from my computer.
